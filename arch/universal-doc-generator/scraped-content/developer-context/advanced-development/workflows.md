# Advanced Development - Workflows

## Overview
Standardized workflows for advanced development operations within developer context.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development
1. **Planning Phase**
   - Define requirements
   - Create technical specifications
   - Estimate timeline
   - Identify dependencies

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Create feature branch
   - Implement core functionality
   - Write unit tests
   - Update documentation

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Run automated tests
   - Perform manual testing
   - Security testing
   - Performance testing

4. **Review Phase**
   - Code review
   - Documentation review
   - Security review
   - Final testing

5. **Deployment Phase**
   - Merge to main branch
   - Deploy to staging
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor performance

## Commands Workflow

### Standard Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run lint         # Run linter

# Deployment
npm run deploy       # Deploy to production
npm run backup       # Create backup
npm run restore      # Restore from backup

# Monitoring
npm run monitor      # Start monitoring
npm run logs         # View logs
npm run health       # Health check
```

## AI Integration Workflow

### 1. AI Model Integration
- Model selection and evaluation
- API integration setup
- Performance optimization
- Monitoring and logging

### 2. AI Call Processing
- Input validation
- Model inference
- Response processing
- Error handling

### 3. AI Workflow Automation
- Automated decision making
- Process optimization
- Quality assurance
- Continuous learning

## Quality Assurance
- Automated testing
- Code quality checks
- Performance monitoring
- Security validation
- Documentation verification
